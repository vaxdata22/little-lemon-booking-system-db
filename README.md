## META DATABASE ENGINEER PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE CAPSTONE PROJECT

### Database project for managing the table booking system of the Little Lemon restaurant

Welcome to this repository!!!

This is a capstone project I undertook to earn the [Meta Database Engineer Professional Certificate credential.](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-database-engineer)

In order to do this project, I was provided with some sample booking data and was asked to save to a database. 

### Introduction

To create a successful Booking implementation, I was asked to complete the following actions:

* Create a database that holds the data.

* Connect to the database using a Python client.

* Create a procedure using Python to react to changes in the data.

* Connect to the database using Tableau.

* Generate data reports using Tableau.

### Overview

The project includes the following items:

* Relevant diagrams and screenshots.

* The data model produced in MySQL Workbench.

* The SQL file of the Little Lemon database schema.

* The workbook that includes all worksheets and dashboards.

## Further notes

* The [Python client for MySQL connection](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/blob/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting/python_client.ipynb) as well as the [database creation file](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/blob/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting/little_lemon_db_creation.sql) are in [The Database and Reporting folder.](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/tree/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting)

* Results of queries, stored procedures, subqueries, and joins are in the [MySQL Workbench Screenshots folder.](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/tree/main/MySQL%20Workbench%20Screenshots)

* Tableau visualization data and visual reporting pictures are in the [Tableau Desktop Screenshots folder.](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/tree/main/Tableau%20Desktop%20Screenshots)

* The file [little_lemon_db_creation.sql](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/blob/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting/little_lemon_db_creation.sql) is an SQL file for the LittleLemonDB database implementation.

* This [lemon_db_creation.sql](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/blob/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting/little_lemon_db_creation.sql) file also contains Triggers and Stored Procedures for the database.

* I've also included a [Tableau Desktop Workbook file](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/blob/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting/little_lemon_workbook.twbx) in [The Database and Reporting folder.](https://github.com/vaxdata22/little-lemon-db/tree/main/The%20Database%20and%20Reporting)
